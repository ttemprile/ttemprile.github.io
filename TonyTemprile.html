							<p>Tony is a Retirement Options Certified Coach™, (Retirement Options Certified Coach™, ). Tony obtained his coaching designation in 2019.  He is a seasoned businessman currently serving as President & Chief Executive Officer of Tangible Solutions in Matthews, North Carolina..  His 30+-year career includes several senior positions as Chief Financial Officer at Iverify for 2 years and Vice-President, Finance at Agility Recovery Solutions for 15 years.  His experience has allowed him to manage and coach many employees and colleagues during that past 30 years.  With 30 years business experience I am especially skilled in helping clients identify concerns and making a plan to help you achieve your retirement goals.</p>
							<p>If you are unsure what you will do when you retire; how to find meaning; or perhaps you and your spouse are facing new communication challenges; </p>
              						<p>I combine decades of training with my blend of warmth, intellect, humor, compassionate questioning and a deep knowledge base to connect you with your experience and make a happy and successful retirement.</p>
              						<p>Tony is a certified executive coach and consultant for leaders who need to achieve significant personal and organizational results.</p>
              						<p>His expertise, insights and engaging style help his clients gain wisdom and clarity, which result in:</p>
              					<ul>
							<li>Executives who lead more effectively</li>
              						<li>Teams that seek to communicate and collaborate, and</li>
              						<li>Organizations that are aligned with business strategy</li>
						</ul>
              						<p>Tony has three decades of coaching and consulting experience in diverse industries, which provides a rich framework for his organizational insights and creative solutions. He brings a thoughtful approach to his work, carefully integrating both his coaching and consulting skills and abilities. When consulting, his focus is on “what you are doing” (i.e., goal setting, problem solving, taking action and achieving results). When coaching, his focus is on “who you are being” (i.e., how you are leading, aligning your values and tapping your gifts). As a client, you will become more consciously aware of how paying attention to – and balancing both – are critically important to your success.</p>
              						<p>When you combine Tony’s keen insights and engaging style with his in-depth skills, technical certifications and broad industry experience, the result is a uniquely-qualified executive coach and organizational consultant.</p>
