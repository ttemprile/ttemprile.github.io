							<p>Intelligent Retirement Coaching has several different options when considering your retirement. Our two options include the Retirement Success Profile and the LifeOptions Profile. The purpose for this page serves as a way to help you get a better understanding of each of the options, and ultimately assist in making the best decision possible for your unique retirement experience. </p>
							<p>LifeOptions Profile (LOP):
The LifeOptions Profile determines your retirement readiness, by assessing 20 different lifestyle & attitude dimensions in 6 life sectors. These sectors include; Career & Work, Finance & Insurance, Health & Wellness, Leisure & Social, Family & Relationships, and Personal Development.
 
The LOP tool is perfect for individuals, as well as corporate or group settings. If the LOP tool is used in a group setting, individuals often choose to continue further with one-on-one coaching.
 
Upon completion of this 99-item assessment, individuals will receive a personalized report that specifies your areas of preparedness, but more importantly identifies shortcomings that will provide a resourceful blueprint for retirement planning and transition. The assessment will assign green, yellow or red for each of the 16 lifestyle dimensions, based directly on your inputs. The last 4 lifestyle dimensions do not get assigned a color, but rather are used to indicate your retirement readiness as compared to other individuals who have previously taken the LOP assessment.
 
After completion, the results will provide a personal, realistic, and relevant analysis of your lifestyle needs, while also giving functional insights on transitioning from your current lifestyle to your new retirement lifestyle.
