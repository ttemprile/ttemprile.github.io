							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Intelligent Retirement Coaching has several different options when considering your retirement. Our two options include the Retirement Success Profile and the LifeOptions Profile. The purpose for this page serves as a way to help you get a better understanding of each of the options, and ultimately assist in making the best decision possible for your unique retirement experience. </p>
							<h4>LifeOptions Profile (LOP): </h4>
							<p>The LifeOptions Profile determines your retirement readiness, by assessing 20 different lifestyle & attitude dimensions in 6 life sectors. These sectors include; Career & Work, Finance & Insurance, Health & Wellness, Leisure & Social, Family & Relationships, and Personal Development. </p>
 
<p>The LOP tool is perfect for individuals, as well as corporate or group settings. If the LOP tool is used in a group setting, individuals often choose to continue further with one-on-one coaching.</p>
 
<p>Upon completion of this 99-item assessment, individuals will receive a personalized report that specifies your areas of preparedness, but more importantly identifies shortcomings that will provide a resourceful blueprint for retirement planning and transition. The assessment will assign green, yellow or red for each of the 16 lifestyle dimensions, based directly on your inputs. The last 4 lifestyle dimensions do not get assigned a color, but rather are used to indicate your retirement readiness as compared to other individuals who have previously taken the LOP assessment.</p>
 
<p>After completion, the results will provide a personal, realistic, and relevant analysis of your lifestyle needs, while also giving functional insights on transitioning from your current lifestyle to your new retirement lifestyle.
							</p>
							<h4> Retirement Success Profile (RSP): </h4>
							<p>The Retirement Success Profile is a tool that uses 15 retirement success factors, which correlate with an effective retirement plan and transition. These factors are used to identify personal strengths, while at the same time highlighting several areas of focus. Each of these 15 factors are broken down deeper with 3 measurements; Expectation, Present Behavior and Variance. 
							</p>
							<p><u>Expectation Score: </u>This is a measure of the amount of preparedness an individual expects to have for the overall retirement transition compared to others that have previously taken the RSP assessment. It also takes into account the individuals attitude towards the retirement process. </p>
							<p><u>Present Behavior Score: </u>The PB score utilizes your current preparedness to compare with others that have taken the assessment. This section should give you a better understanding of how prepared you actively are for this new life transition into retirement. </p>
							
							<p><u>Variance Score:</u>The final score is variance score and uses data from both the Expectation Score and Present Behavior Score to calculate the difference between the two. It should help you answer the question, “How ready am I right now compared to the level of preparation I wish to have during my retirement transition?” This section should help individuals understand what sectors of Retirement Success they need to focus on to maximize their preparedness for retirement. The quantitative results will also reveal what sectors need more attention than those of the other sectors. </p>
							<p>The RSP assessment is primarily designed for people currently planning their retirement or already retired, but can be just as useful for those that are just beginning to think about retirement in general. The assessment consists of 120 questions and should take around 30 minutes to complete. After completion of the RSP assessment, you will be given a report that will include 45 total scores, three scores for each of the 15 factors. </p>
